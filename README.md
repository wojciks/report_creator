# report_creator
No more txt noon reports! Just configure excel file access and fill in nav data once!

## Purpose
This program is developed to help navigators with their daily reporting routine.


## Another useless reporting tool?
One of the biggest burdens of navigational officers nowadays is reporting. Just after taking over noon  watch a nightmare of copying and pasting of various data takes place to satisfy -sometimes very strange - report requirements of various parties.

Usually  data is being read from some sort of excel file generated by engineers regarding fuel consumption and performance of various machinery in Engine Room. Then this data is being copied and pasted to numerous text file based reports to be sent to different interested parties, like owners, charterers, weather services etc. For keyboard skilled navigator this takes usually more or less half an hour. Half an hour that ship sails without too much navigational supervision. That means heightened risk of collision or other incident related to the ship movement. Not to mention getting the wrong data copied to the wrong place in report and causing cascade of uneasy questions to the captain.

## Libraries used:
+ `xlrd` for reading excel files,
+ `sqlite3` for database operations,
+ `json` for config file processing,
+ `PySimpleGUI` for GUI.


## Features already implemented
+ report_creator access excel file and reads data and saves it to text files, according to configuration variables to be edited by the user. It can fill up multiple text files in one go!
+ Database integration, so to perform operations on past data.
+ Basic navigation calculations based on user entry (avg speed from last event, Beaufort scale winds).
+ Config file is in JSON format, data row/column source in excel being updated if user is happy with reports.
+ Simple, NOT 'idiotproof' GUI made in `PySimpleGUI`

## Future features:
+ Navigation calculations: total voyage time, currents, LT, voyage distances and average speeds.
+ Data validation - just in case someone will put this additional zero in the wrong place!
+ GUI to be made 'idiotproof', so it will not accept wrong inputs. 
+ Executable format, so on ships without possibility of installing python interpreter, software still can be used.

## Going further:
+ Filling up inconvenient HTML forms sometimes companies use to generate reports in format that is convenient for them, or mimicking functionality of these forms.
+ Specialised reports in different formats to answer growing needs of companies (PDF, CSV, XLS, and others).
+ Additional features, like graphically showing relative wind direction and other

## Known issues:
+ **THE CODE.** It is still a very early development stage and app needs plenty of refactoring.
+ Database integration - at the moment no navigational calculations are being done (that means no voyage distances, total steaming times, average speeds)
+ Database consists only one table. More tables should be used so more features could be implemented.
