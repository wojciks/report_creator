# report_creator
No more txt noon reports! Just configure excel file access and fill in nav data once!

###Purpose
This program is developed to help navigators with their daily reporting routine.


###Another useless reporting tool?
One of the biggest burdens of navigational officers nowadays is reporting. Just after taking over noon  watch a nightmare of copying and pasting of various data takes place to satisfy -sometimes very strange - report requirements of various parties.

Usually  data is being read from some sort of excel file generated by engineers regarding fuel consumption and performance of various machinery in Engine Room. Then this data is being copied and pasted to numerous text file based reports to be sent to different interested parties, like owners, charterers, weather services etc. For keyboard skilled navigator this takes usually more or less half an hour. Half an hour that ship sails without too much navigational supervision. That means heightened risk of collision or other incident related to the ship movement. Not to mention getting the wrong data copied to the wrong place in report and causing cascade of uneasy questions to the captain.

###Libraries used:
+ `xlrd` for reading excel files.
+ `sqlite3` for database operations.


###Features already implemented
+ report_creator access excel file and reads data and saves it to text files, according to configuration variables to be edited by the user. It can fill up multiple text files in one go!
+ Database integration, so to keep all data in nice and convenient format.

###Future features:
+ Navigation calculations: total voyage time, currents, LT, distances and average speeds.
+ Data validation - just in case someone will put this additional zero in the wrong place!
+ GUI, to make data entry intuitive and convenient
+ executable format, so on ships without possibility of installing python interpreter, software still can be used.

###Going further:
+ filling up inconvenient HTML forms sometimes companies use to generate reports in format that is convenient for them, or mimicking functionality of these forms.
+ specialised reports in different formats to answer growing needs of companies (PDF, CSV, XLS, and others)

###Known issues:
+ **THE CODE.** It is still a very early development stage and app needs plenty of refactoring. Usage of global variables is too common.
+ Unable to change the row/column in excel for next event/date in other way than changing `FIRST_DATA` global variable in `appconf.py`
+ Database integration - at the moment no navigational calculations are being done (that means no voyage distances, total steaming times, average speeds)
+ Database consists only one table. More tables should be used so more features could be implemented. 
+ Configuration file is a Python file `appconf.py` - should be `*.ini` or equivalent, so executable can utilize it.
